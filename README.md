## CI/CD Pipeline

### Overview
CI/CD pipelines automate the development process by integrating code changes frequently and deploying them automatically. This approach enables faster deployment, automated testing, and reduces manual errors in the development workflow.

### Benefits
- **Faster Deployment**: Automated processes reduce deployment time significantly
- **Automated Testing**: Ensures code quality through automated unit and integration tests
- **Reduced Manual Errors**: Automation minimizes human error in deployment processes

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and deployment workflows
- **Docker**: For containerization and consistent deployment environments
